          Handling C-suite buyers is a different experience altogether. The
          expectation mismatch between the executive buyer and the seller
          ruptures good deals and stalls them over silly matters. But
          considering the involvement of C-level guys faster in sales deals,
          sellers must learn to conquer their fear and prepare in advance for
          the C-level buyer.

                existed for the "big bosses," writes Bloomberg, this number is
                "eye-popping high” during the pandemic.
